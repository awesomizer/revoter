%h3 Real Democarcy in the Senate
  %p
    The US Senate is radically undemocratic. Because each states gets the same number of Senators, people in larger states can have much less power in the federal government then those from smaller states.  This compromise might have made sense at our nation's founding, when the largest state had X times the population of the smallest state.  Today that spread is about 70-1.
